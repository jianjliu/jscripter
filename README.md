# jscripter
JScripter(JS) is not another programming language but a set of specifications and Java libraries elaborately designed to simulate the key features of JavaScript language for pure Java environment by providing facilities of constructing and accessing objects in an object-based manner.

With JS Libraries, Java programmers can develop JS applications and other JS class libraries in pure Java language as well as JS applets (or JsApplets) which can be loaded and run as usual Java applets on any LiveConnect-well-supported main-stream web browsers owing to the deliberate designing and testing effort by the author.

More importantly, JS applets (or JsApplets) can be converted into JavaScript code by JS Virtualizer or JS re-compilers (such as JRecompiler) complying with the JS Re-compilation Specification.

In accordance with the conformation of JScripter(JS) 1.0, JS Virtualizers and JS re-compilers complying with the JS Specification must read binary class files instead of source files of JsApplets and conform their conversion results in JavaScript language to Standard ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification.

JS Libraries consists of 4 parts:

    JS Standard Library
    JS Emulation Library
    JS Simulation Library
    JS Virtualizer

JScripter(JS) makes it possible to productively build and efficiently manage larger client side JavaScript applications with browser dependencies eliminated.

The larger your application is, the more benefit you get with JScripter:

    Fully Object-Oriented developing process.
    More choices of IDEs for the strong-typed Java language.
    Much less bugs.
    Code re-usability.
    Much easier documentation.
    Efficiency of code.
    Release your work in binary classes.
    Share your code in binary classes.
    Easier team management.

JScripter Libraries are written in pure Java and require JDK 1.5 or above.
