	 * <p>This method adds the specified event <tt>listener</tt> function to the set of 
	 * listeners registered on this node to handle events of the specified <tt>type</tt>. 
	 * If <tt>useCapture</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, the <tt>listener</tt> is registered as 
	 * a capturing event listener. If <tt>useCapture</tt> is <tt>false</tt>, it is 
	 * registered as a normal event listener.</p>
	 * <p>This method may be called multiple times to register multiple event handlers 
	 * for the same type of event on the same node. Note, however, that the DOM 
	 * Specification makes no guarantees about the order in which multiple event handlers 
	 * are invoked.</p>
	 * <p>If the same event listener function is registered twice on the same node with 
	 * the same <tt>type</tt> and <tt>useCapture</tt> arguments, the second registration 
	 * is simply ignored. If a new event listener is registered on this node while an 
	 * event is being handled at this node, the new event listener is not invoked for 
	 * that event.</p>
	 * <p>When a node is duplicated with {@link JsNode#cloneNode(Boolean)} or {@link JsDocument#importNode(JsNode, Boolean)},

	 * and {@link JsWindow} objects.</p>
	 * @param type The type of event for which the event listener is to be invoked.
	 * @param listener The event listener function that is invoked when an event of the 
	 * specified type is dispatched to this node. When invoked, the listener function 
	 * is passed an {@link JsEvent} object and is invoked as a method of the node on 
	 * which it is registered.
	 * @param useCapture If <tt>true</tt>, the specified <tt>listener</tt> is to be 
	 * invoked only during the capturing phase of event propagation. The more common 
	 * value of <tt>false</tt> means that the <tt>listener</tt> is not invoked during 
	 * the capturing phase but instead is invoked when this node is the actual event 
	 * target or when the event bubbles up to this node from its original target.

	 * <li>The event handler names passed to the IE methods should include the "on" 
	 * prefix.</li>
	 * <li>Functions registered with this method are invoked with no {@link JsEvent} 
	 * {@link JsWindow#event} property of 
	 * {@link JsWindow#window} object.</li>
	 * <li>Functions registered with this method are invoked as global functions, rather 
	 * than as methods of the node on which the event occurred. That is, when an event 
	 * handler registered with this method executes, the <tt>this</tt> keyword refers to 
	 * {@link JsWindow#window} object, not to the event's target node.</li>
	 * <li>This method allows the same event handler function to be registered more than 
	 * once. When an event of the specified type occurs, the registered function is 
	 * invoked as many times as it is registered.</li>
