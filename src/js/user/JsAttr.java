/**
 * <p>An <b>opaque</b> class representing JavaScript client-side objects of the global 
 * {@link JsClient#Attr} class.</p>
 * <p>An object of this opaque class represents an attribute of an {@link JsElement} node. 
 * Objects of this opaque class are associated with {@link JsElement} nodes but are not 
 * directly part of the document tree (and have a <tt>null</tt> {@link JsNode#parentNode} 
 * property. You can obtain an <tt>JsAttr</tt> object through the {@link JsNode#attributes} 
 * property or by calling the {@link JsElement#getAttributeNode(String)} or {@link JsElement#getAttributeNodeNS(String, String)} 
 * methods.</p>
 * <p>The value of an attribute is represented by the descendant nodes of a node of this 
 * opaque class. In HTML documents, a node of this opaque class always has a single Text 
 * node child, and the {@link JsAttr#value} property provides a shortcut for reading and 
 * writing the value of this child node.</p>
 * <p>The XML grammar allows XML documents to have attributes that consist of Text nodes 
 * and EntityReference nodes, which is why an attribute value cannot be fully represented 
 * by a string. In practice, however, web browsers expand any entity references in XML 
 * attribute values and do not implement the EntityReference interface. Therefore, in 
 * client-side JavaScript, the {@link JsAttr#value} property is all that is needed to 
 * read and write attribute values.</p>
 * <p>Since attribute values can be completely represented by strings, it is not usually 
 * necessary to use this opaque class at all. In most cases, the easiest way to work 
 * with attributes is with the {@link JsElement#getAttribute(String)} and 
 * {@link JsElement#setAttribute(String, Object)} methods. These methods use strings 
 * for attribute values and avoid the use of this class altogether.</p>
