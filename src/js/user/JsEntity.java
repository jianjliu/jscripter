/**
 * <p>An <b>opaque</b> class representing JavaScript client-side <tt>Entity</tt> nodes.</p>
 * <p>This <b>opaque</b> class represents an entity, either parsed or unparsed, in an 
 * XML document. Programmers working exclusively with HTML documents never need to use 
 * this class.</p>
 * <p>Note that DOM2 specification only models the entity itself not the entity declaration. 
 * Entity declaration modeling has been left for a later Level of the DOM specification.</p>
 * <p>The inherited {@link JsNode#nodeName} attribute contains the name of the entity.</p>
 * <p>An XML processor may choose to completely expand entities before the structure 
 * model is passed to the DOM. In this case there will be no {@link JsEntityReference} 
 * nodes in the document tree.</p>
 * <p>XML does not mandate that a non-validating XML processor read and process entity 
 * declarations made in the external subset or declared in external parameter entities. 
 * This means that parsed entities declared in the external subset need not be expanded 
 * by some classes of applications, and that the replacement value of the entity may not 
 * be available. When the replacement value is available, the corresponding {@link JsEntity} 
 * node's child list represents the structure of that replacement text. Otherwise, the 
 * child list is empty.</p>
 * <p>The DOM Level 2 does not support editing {@link JsEntity} nodes. If you want to 
 * make changes to the contents of a {@link JsEntity} node, every related {@link JsEntityReference} 
 * node has to be replaced in the structure model by a clone of the contents of the {@link JsEntity} 
 * node, and then the desired changes must be made to each of those clones instead. {@link JsEntity} 
 * nodes and all their descendants  are read-only.</p>
 * <p>A {@link JsEntity} node does not have any parent, that is, {@link JsNode#parentNode} 
 * property for a {@link JsEntity} node is always <tt>null</tt>.</p>
 * <p>If the entity contains an unbound name space prefix, the {@link JsNode#namespaceURI} 
 * property of the corresponding node in the {@link JsEntity} node subtree is <tt>null</tt>. 
 * The same is <tt>true</tt> for {@link JsEntityReference} nodes that refer to this entity, 
 * when they are created using the {@link JsDocument#createEntityReference(String)} method. 
 * The DOM Level 2 does not support any mechanism to resolve name space prefixes.</p>
 * <p>Note that main-stream web browsers do not support the <tt>Entity</tt> interface 
 * declared by the DOM Core Specification. This <b>opaque</b> class inherits directly 
 * from {@link JsNode} and for documentation purpose only.</p>
