 * <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> tag.</p>
 * <p>This class represents an HTML canvas element. It has no behavior of its own but 
 * defines an API that supports scripted client-side drawing operations. You may specify 
 * the {@link JsHTMLCanvasElement#width} and {@link JsHTMLCanvasElement#height} properties 
 * directly on an object of this type, but most of its functionality is available via 
 * the object of {@link JsCanvasRenderingContext2D} obtained by calling the {@link JsHTMLCanvasElement#getContext(String)} 
 * method of the {@link JsHTMLCanvasElement} object and passing the literal string "2d" 
 * as the sole argument.</p>
 * <p>The <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> tag and its API is not supported by but can be simulated 
 * in IE with an open source project called <a href = "http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">ExplorerCanvas</a>.</p>
