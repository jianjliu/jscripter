/**
 * <p>An <b>opaque</b> class representing JavaScript client-side objects of the global 
 * {@link JsClient#HTMLIFrameElement} class.</p>
 * <p>This class represents an inline sub-window 
 * in an HTML page, or a {@link JsHTMLElement} object created with the HTML 
 * <tt>&lt;iframe&gt;</tt> tag.</p>
 * <p>An object of this class behaves very much like that of {@link JsHTMLFrameElement} 
 * except for small differences in their attribute members. {@link JsHTMLIFrameElement} 
 * objects become part of the {@link JsWindow#frames} array of the containing window. 
 * When accessed through that array, they are represented by {@link JsWindow}, and the 
 * properties listed in {@link JsHTMLIFrameElement} do not apply.</p> 
 * <p>When an <tt>&lt;iframe&gt;</tt> element is accessed as a document element by ID 
 * or tag name, it is represented by this class, with all the properties available. Use 
 * {@link JsHTMLIFrameElement#src} to query or set the URL of the element, and use 
 * {@link JsHTMLIFrameElement#contentDocument} to access the contents of the <tt>&lt;iframe&gt;</tt> 
 * element. Be aware, however, that the same-origin policy may prevent access to the 
 * {@link JsHTMLIFrameElement#contentDocument} property.</p>
